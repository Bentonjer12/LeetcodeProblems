### 70. Climbing Stairs:

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 45
### 1486. XOR Operation in an Array:

Given an integer n and an integer start.

Define an array nums where nums[i] = start + 2*i (0-indexed) and n == nums.length.

Return the bitwise XOR of all elements of nums.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, start = 0
Output: 8
Explanation: Array nums is equal to [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] where (0 ^ 2 ^ 4 ^ 6 ^ 8) = 8.
Where "^" corresponds to bitwise XOR operator.
Example 2:

Input: n = 4, start = 3
Output: 8
Explanation: Array nums is equal to [3, 5, 7, 9] where (3 ^ 5 ^ 7 ^ 9) = 8.
Example 3:

Input: n = 1, start = 7
Output: 7
Example 4:

Input: n = 10, start = 5
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000
0 <= start <= 1000
n == nums.length

### 1189. Maximum Number of Ballons:

Given a string text, you want to use the characters of text to form as many instances of the word "balloon" as possible.

You can use each character in text at most once. Return the maximum number of instances that can be formed.

 

Example 1:



Input: text = "nlaebolko"
Output: 1
Example 2:



Input: text = "loonbalxballpoon"
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: text = "leetcode"
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= text.length <= 10^4
text consists of lower case English letters only.

### 7. Reverse Integer:
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21
Example 4:

Input: x = 0
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
